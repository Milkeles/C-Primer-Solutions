Generally, the two loops can be used for the same purposes in most problems. Sometimes, we have to use one instead of the other. For example, it is better to use a ``for`` loop when we know the number of iterations beforehand. A ``while`` loop is to be used when we don't know how many times we want the loop to run (how many iterations it should have), but we want it to run so long as a given condition is true. Also, for design purposes, it is better to use a ``while`` loop when we create infinite loops, although both the ``for`` loop and the ``while`` loop can run forever.

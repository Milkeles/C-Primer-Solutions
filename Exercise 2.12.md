`(a)` – `invalid` because it uses a keyword for its identifier.<br> 
`(b)` – ``valid``, unless it is defined outside a function, because identifiers defined outside a function cannot begin with an underscore.<br>
`(c)` – ``invalid`` because it uses a dash, variable names must consist only of letters, numbers, and underscores.<br>
`(d)` – ``invalid`` because it begins with a number.<br>
``(e)`` – ``valid``.<br>

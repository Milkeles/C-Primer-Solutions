(a) is a **definition** because, although we use the keyword `extern`, we initialize the variable with a value.<br>
The second one is also a **definition**, because we don't use the keyword `extern`. <br>
(c) is a **declaration** because it uses the keyword `extern` and also does not initialize the variable with a value.
